Code for analysing PSF models for Weak Lensing in DES. In particular
this code is for the analysis of the DESDM PSFEx and Shapelet PSF
model for SPTE of SVA1.

See the Redmine DES wikipage for more information on the project:

Quick note on the code:

psf_analyser.py            - is the main working horse for the catalogue generation
compute_rho_stats.py       - main script for the computation of the rho statistics
launcher.py                - helps to create the launcher files required by wq, 
                             i.e. scheduler on BNL
launcher_rho.py            - ditto, to create launchers for the computation of the 
                             rho statistics
config.rho1.template       - template configuration files for Athena
config.rho2.template       - template configuration files for Athena
corr2.config.rho1.template - template configuration file for corr2 by Mike Jarvis
im3shape_psf_tools.py      - contains a Python implementation of im3shape's functions
                             for PSF handling 
evaluate.py                - script for making plots
spte_iz_list               - exposure list (borrowed from Bob Armstrong)
